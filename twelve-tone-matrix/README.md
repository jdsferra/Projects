# Welcome to the 12-Tone Matrix Calculator!   
You will be prompted to enter 12 non-repeating numbers between 0 and 11. These numbers correspond to a sequence of pitch classes that we will use to make the prime row.

The code does the rest of the work, spitting out a 12x12 matrix based on the prime row.  

## The matrix gives you 48 versions of the row to analyze/compose with:
- Prime form (Rows Read Left to Right)
- Retrograde (Rows Read Right to Left)
- Inversion (Columns Read Top to Bottom)
- Retrograde Inversion (Columns Read Bottom to Top)

The numbers outside of the list label the rows by their starting pitch:  
*Retrograde use the last pitch number so it corresponds to the non-retrograde ordering*
